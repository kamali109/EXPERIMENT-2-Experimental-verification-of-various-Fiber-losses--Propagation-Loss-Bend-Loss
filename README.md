## 🔍 EX.NO: 2 – Verification of Fiber Losses

**Aim:**  
To measure propagation and bending losses for two wavelengths in plastic fiber.

**Equipments Required:**  
- Link-B Kit  
- Patch chords  
- Oscilloscope  
- Function Generator  
- Fiber cables  

**Theory:**  
- Losses due to absorption, scattering, bending  
- Plastic fiber loss ~180 dB/km  
- Bending loss increases with reduced loop diameter

**Procedure:**  
- Setup for 660nm and 950nm measurements  
- Measure output voltages for 1m and 3m fibers  
- Calculate attenuation \( a \) using:
  V1/V2 = e [ -a (L1+L2 ) ] 
- Bend fiber and record output vs diameter

### Propagation Loss

| Fiber Length | Input Amplitude (V) | Output Amplitude (V) |
|--------------|---------------------|------------------------|
|        1               5                      10
|        0.5             5           |       14

### Bending Loss

| Bending Diameter | Input Amplitude (V) | Output Amplitude (V) |
|------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
|   1 for 8cm      |  5                   |    10.3                    
    0.5 for 6.4cm     5                        9.76
    
**Result:** 

The experiment successfully verified the losses in a fiber-optic link:

The propagation (transmission) loss was measured over different lengths of the fiber for two wavelengths (660 nm & 950 nm) and found to increase with length, confirming the expected attenuation behaviour.

The bending loss was observed by varying the loop diameter of the fiber and measuring output amplitude — as the bend diameter decreased, the output dropped, verifying increased bending loss.

Hence, the aim of measuring both propagation loss and bending loss characteristics of the fiber was achieved.
